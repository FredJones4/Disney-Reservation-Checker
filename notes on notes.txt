This is the original message from disney, where the "015177" was the 6 digit code given. In this situation, it might be
necessary to learn how to grab the code from the email and then input it manually.

It might also be needed to learn how to simply "refresh" the page once all the data has been submitted the first time, so that Disney doesn't get mad when I
try to log on over and over again.
